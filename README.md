**Governance implementation tools in a push multi-account environment implemented in the Go language.**

# Solution

# Feature
Applying governance to the various accounts that exist within a company is not easy. Moreover, it is very difficult to visualize the security requirements if there is **no access authority to each account**.
If there are no access privileges, we thought that we could apply governance to the accounts themselves by generating information as a batch process and sending the information in a **push type**, while still maintaining security requirements.
